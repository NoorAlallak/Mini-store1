1-I used axios to get the data from the 3 api's.
2-(Home Page):
A.I took the data from the product api to show the products information.I used the sort based on categories and passed the categorie type from the select to the api,I used another sort based on the price and the first letter of the product title and there is also a search bar.
B.when you press on the product card the product id is passed to the product details page to display the full information of the product.
2-(cart page)I used the create context,context provider and use context to use the functions related to the cart (add,remove,quantity..etc) in the cart component in order for the user to checkout his order.
3-check out page a page that includes a form with inputs. the user should provide some information in order to confirm his order.
4- a wishlist page I also used the context to add the products into the favourite page.
5-i only translated the checkout page using the i18n+rtl.
6-i did the infinite Scroll instead of pagination in the home page.
